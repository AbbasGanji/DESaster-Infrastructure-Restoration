This package is aimed to simulate the post-disaster process of infrastructure restoration. The developed methodology is topologically-explicit and resource-aware and obtained by combining network modeling and process-based discrete-event simulation modeling. 
This methodology considers the network structure of infrastructure systems, allocates resources according to user-defined variables, and generates scheduling and estimate restoration timeframes. Input data required to execute the module includes infrastructure networks and their connections, needed resources and time to fix entities, damage state (deterministically or probabilistically), and priorities. Moreover, complex resource availabilities can be inserted for different types of resources, including experts (or crews), equipment (or supply), and budget. Five files, located in the "input" directory, are used to set up the model and insert the input data. The process is simulated by executing the "run.py". Output files are generated by running the model and located in the "output" directory. 
More details about input and output files are provided in their directories.
